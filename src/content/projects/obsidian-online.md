## Key features
- Open your notes anywhere (with internet)
- Support for LaTex, Smiles and wikilinks
- Partial support for Excalidraw (everything except file embeds, help needed)
- Simple design

## Contributors welcome
If you want to help, please do so! This project is just a simple quick implementation that is not properly rafined and the code needs refactoring. These are some things that I would like to do:
* Code refactoring
* Proper excalidraw support
* Support for obsidian canvases
* Other plugins and filetype support

Maybe:
* GitHub authorization for viewing private repositories
* GitHub quick edit, to quickly edit the markdown file in the browser (can be done all with the API)
