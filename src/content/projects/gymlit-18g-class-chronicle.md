My class maintains a chronicle containing funny stuff that teachers said and events that happened. This is the online version of it. It uses the [Astro](https://astro.build) framework with SSR. The whole website is for Czech speakers and should be accessed mainly by people interested in the topic. It does not serve a purpose to humiliate anyone.
